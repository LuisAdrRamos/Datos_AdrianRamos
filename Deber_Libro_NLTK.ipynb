            "partly out of regard to your sister, would never have it mentioned,\n",
            "and did intend to conceal it from the world; and therefore, sir, if\n",
            "you had not mentioned it to me first, I am certain I should never have\n",

            "We have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a man to\n",

            "In\n",
            "reality, the promises which Blifil had made to Dowling were the\n",

            "had no time to consider of evasions.\n",
            "Allworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation, and, having\n",
            "enjoined on Dowling strict silence as to what had past, conducted that\n",
            "gentleman himself to the door, lest he should see Blifil, who was\n",

            "As Allworthy was returning to his room he met Mrs Miller in the entry,\n",
            "who, with a face all pale and full of terror, said to him, \"O!\n",

            "into my room.\n",
            "Indeed, Mrs Miller, I have made surprizing discoveries,\n",
            "and you shall soon know them.\"\n",
            "The poor woman followed him trembling; and now Allworthy, going up to\n",

            "the whole story, and how the youth came to pass for her son.\n",
            "Indeed,\n",
            "Mrs Miller, I am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that I have\n",
            "been abused; abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a\n",
            "villain.\n",
            "He is, in truth, the worst of villains.\"\n",
            "The joy which Mrs Miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech,\n",

            "At\n",
            "length, recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak,\n",
            "she cried, \"And is my dear Mr Jones then your nephew, sir, and not the\n",

            "presently left the two ladies together.\n",
            "Mr Blifil, hearing the chair ordered, came downstairs to attend upon\n",

            "He asked\n",
            "his uncle if he was going out, which is a civil way of asking a man\n",
            "whither he is going: to which the other making no answer, he again\n",

            "At length he arrived at Mr Western's, and was\n",
            "introduced to Sophia.\n",
            "When the first ceremonies were past, and the gentleman and lady had\n",
            "taken their chairs, a silence of some minutes ensued; during which the\n",
            "latter, who had been prepared for the visit by her father, sat playing\n",
            "with her fan, and had every mark of confusion both in her countenance\n",
            "and behaviour.\n",
            "At length Allworthy, who was himself a little\n",
            "disconcerted, began thus: \"I am afraid, Miss Western, my family hath\n",

            "relieve you from them.\"\n",
            "\"Sir,\" said Sophia, with a little modest hesitation, \"this behaviour\n",
            "is most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Mr\n",
            "Allworthy; but as you have been so kind to mention this matter, you\n",
            "will pardon me for saying it hath, indeed, given me great uneasiness,\n",
            "and hath been the occasion of my suffering much cruel treatment from\n",

            "gentleman; insomuch that his lordship, who was strictly a man of\n",
            "honour, and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the\n",
            "world in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for\n",
            "the advice which he had taken.\n",
            "Within a day or two after this, Lord Fellamar happened to dine with\n",
